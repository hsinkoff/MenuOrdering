This file contains the ruby code to find an order that comes out to an exact total.  
It also contains an example file for the format of the menu.

To use the code, first place the text file with the total price and menu options in the same folder as the file with the code.
You will then be able to run the code in the terminal.  To run the code type "ruby" space "name of file with code" space "name of file with menu".
You should not type the quatation marks.  An example would be: ruby codefile.rb menufile.txt
